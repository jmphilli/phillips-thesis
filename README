There is a compiled SchemeMidi.rkt file in the HardwareLink directory.
Use the linux directory for Linux. 

On linux you need jack installed.
There is a README in that directory telling you how to set it up, but its
pretty straightforward.

You need some sort of midi device to send data. (It can be virtual or physical.) 
(I have a simple example written for OS X)
Start up your midi device.

Install the `midi' directory to a library path for Racket (e.g. ~/Library/Racket/5.0.1/collects/midi)

Open Driver.rkt and run (run tempo) with whatever tempo 
you want to play at.

The performer that is included in the top of the file (1 2 or 3) relates
to different algorithms for choosing the music to perform.  (music value-functions)
performer1 is the most recent, or top of the queue algorithm
performer2 is the rhythmic performer, choosing music based on its rhythm values
performer3 is the melodic performer, choosing music based on the pitch values.

The performer that is included in the top of the Performer/Performer_.rkt file
(user or user2) relates to the performer that generates the music for the 
framework. user is the cadential performer. user2 is the scalar performer.

Once you are connected and running you should be able to play music on your keyboard
and start to hear the system react. It may take some vamping on chords to make
sure everything is working. Start with something simple like a bpm of 120 and 
C major for a second followed by G major for a second. That should start performing
quite quickly (~5 seconds). Make sure your volume on your computer is up. 
Once you are sure it is working, feel free to perform more complicated music,
the one limitation being that if you go from C major to F# major, (perform in
very distintly related keys...) it probably won't work. Just restart the system
and that should clear everything out.
