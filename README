There is a compiled SchemeMidi.rkt file in the HardwareLink directory.
Use the linux directory for Linux. 

On linux you need jack installed.
There is a README in that directory telling you how to set it up, but its
pretty straightforward.

You need some sort of midi device to send data. (It can be virtual or physical.) 
(I have a simple example written for OS X)
Start up your midi device.

Open Driver.rkt and run (connect) and then (run tempo) with whatever tempo 
you want to play at. Or simply run (j) for a tempo of 120.

The performer that is included in the top of the file (1 2 or 3) relates
to different algorithms for choosing the music to perform.
